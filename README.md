# Face Recognition and Verification
 
**Face verification** is the task of checking a candidate's face against another candidate to see if it is a match. it has many applications, One of the applications is a biometric system in which software uses a facial image of a person captured by a camera to determine whether that person belongs to a predefined group of people who are allowed to perform a certain action. Traditional methods of deep learning like calsification are not efficient because:

1. Classification networks need a long training period due to the addition of new users
2. Thousands of images have to train classification networks, which is impossible because there is only a small number of sample images available per user.
